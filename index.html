  				<h3>Job Experience:</h3>
  				<p>After graduating high school, I was trained as a test processor and tutor for a local Christian academy. One year later, I was trained and hired as a content developer for an Inbound marketing agency in Washington.</p>

  				<p>During my time as a writer, I had the opportunity to create several websites for clients using WordPress. Inspired by the beauty, complexity, and power of many impressive websites, I realized the kind of potential these websites could have for small businesses and non-profits. Driven by a desire to create functional, impressive, and memorable websites, I chose to pursue a career in website design and development.</p>

  				<p>After receiving my high school diploma, I took a year of college classes at Clackamas Community College before deciding to attend Epicodus.</p>
